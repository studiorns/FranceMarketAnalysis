| December | 2,497 | 1,352 | -0.46 | 0.98 | 0.95 | 0.93 |

## Brand Health Multiplier

The Brand Health Multiplier is calculated using:
```
Brand Health Multiplier = 1 + ((Projected Brand Consideration Growth) * Brand Health Coefficient)
```

Where:
```
Projected Brand Consideration Growth = (Target Brand Consideration - Current Brand Consideration) / Current Brand Consideration
```

For France, using the data provided:
- Current Brand Consideration (Q4 2024): 22.99%
- Target Brand Consideration (Conservative): 24.00%
- Target Brand Consideration (Moderate): 25.00%
- Target Brand Consideration (Ambitious): 26.00%

Projected Brand Consideration Growth:
- Conservative: (24.00% - 22.99%) / 22.99% = 0.044
- Moderate: (25.00% - 22.99%) / 22.99% = 0.087
- Ambitious: (26.00% - 22.99%) / 22.99% = 0.131

Brand Health Multiplier:
- Conservative: 1 + (0.044 * 0.15) = 1.007
- Moderate: 1 + (0.087 * 0.20) = 1.017
- Ambitious: 1 + (0.131 * 0.25) = 1.033

## Complete Forecast Calculation

For each month and scenario, the forecast is calculated using:
```
Forecast = 2024 Queries * Base Growth Factor * Seasonality Index * Media Multiplier * Flight Search Factor * Brand Health Multiplier
```

For example, for January under the Moderate scenario:
```
Forecast = 31.25 * 1.10 * 1.15 * 1.08 * 1.19 * 1.017 = 45.12
```
